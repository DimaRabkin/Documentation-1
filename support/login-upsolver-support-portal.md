Be sure to select the correct **Priority**, because this determines the response time with your ticket. 
{% endhint %}

### Update or respond to a support case

After you submit a case, you are automatically redirected to the case details page.

On this page you can review previously added comments or add a new comment at the bottom of the page.

Alternatively, you can respond to a support case by replying to the new comment notifications that are sent to your email inbox.

If you navigate away from the case details page, you can always return by clicking the **My activities** button on the top right corner.
