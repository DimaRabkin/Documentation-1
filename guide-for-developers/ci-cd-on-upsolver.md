# CI/CD on Upsolver

## Continuous Integration and Development \(CI/CD\) in Upsolver

CI/CD is a set of methodologies used to frequently deliver new features to customers. 

The main CI/CD frameworks are continuous integration, continuous delivery, and continuous deployment. CI/CD is used to solve problems that development and operations teams often encounter when integrating new code. 

Implementing CI/CD in databases can be challenging, but Upsolverâ€™s event sourcing architecture makes it easy to apply CI/CD principles throughout your development lifecycle.

## About CI/CD

* Only need CI/CD for ETL code \(raw data is stored as an immutable log\)
* Isolation between dev and prod
* GIT integration for ETL code source control
* REST API for infra-as-code
