# Amazon AppFlow data source

To help you get started with Upsolver, you can try it out for free. Sign up for [**Upsolver Dedicated Compute**](https://app.upsolver.com/signup) ****subscription to use Amazon AppFlow. It gives you free Upsolver units \(UUs\), units of processing capability per hour based on VM instance type.

You can also use Upsolver through [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B07T8JDQ57?ref_=srh_res_product_title). All of the options will allow you to ingest data to Amazon S3, perform transformations with simple SQL, and output to your favorite database or analytics toolsâ€”in minutes.What is Amazon AppFlow

{% hint style="info" %}
Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed integration service that enables you to securely transfer data between Software-as-a-Service \(SaaS\) applications like Salesforce, Marketo, Slack, and ServiceNow, and AWS services like Amazon Athena, Amazon S3 and Amazon Redshift, in just a few clicks.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Make sure you're logged into the AWS account that you're running AppFlow from.
{% endhint %}

4. Define the connection integration information. Click on **LAUNCH INTEGRATION**.

* **NAME** is the name of the connection between Upsolver and Amazon AppFlow. You will use this connection for the data coming from Amazon AppFlow to Upsolver. You can create multiple data sources using the same connection. 
* **BUCKET NAME** is the S3 bucket that AppFlow sends its data for Upsolver to process. The example shown below has the BUCKET NAME called **googleanalytics**. The integration will automatically create a Amazon S3 bucket name called **appsolver-appflow-googleanalytics.** This is the bucket that you will select when you set up your Flow later on.

## Create a flow on Amazon AppFlow

1. Navigate to your AppFlow service in your AWS environment and click on **Create flow**.

![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%28181%29.png)

2. Give the flow a name and description. This example collects data from google analytics. Click on **Next**.

6. Choose Upsolver as your destination. From the first section - _Create an Amazon Appflow data source connection_ step 4, you've created an AppFlow connection with BUCKET NAME called googleanalytics. Behind the scenes, it automatically created an Amazon S3 bucket called **upsolver-appflow-googleanalytics**. This bucket will show up as an option when you create an Upsolver destination. Select the **upsolver-appflow-googleanalytics** bucket.
