# HDFS data source

### What is Apache Hadoop?

Apache Hadoop is a collection of open-source software utilities that facilitate using a network of many computers to solve problems involving massive amounts of data and computation. It provides a software framework for distributed storage and processing of big data using the MapReduce programming model.

### What is HDFS?

Hadoop Distributed File System \(HDFS\) is a distributed file-system that stores data on commodity machines, providing very high aggregate bandwidth across the cluster.

As HDFS provides better data throughput than traditional file systems, in addition to high fault tolerance and native support of large datasets, it is used to scale a single Apache Hadoop cluster to hundreds \(and even thousands\) of nodes.
