# I can't connect to my Kafka cluster

In order to connect to your Kafka cluster which is placed in another VPC, you have to peer your VPC with the VPC created for Upsolver. 

**See:** [VPC peering](../upsolver-aws-deployment-guide/vpc-peering.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
If you want to run Upsolver in an **existing VPC**, contact us via the intercom widget \(in the right bottom corner\), or by email: support@upsolver.com.
{% endhint %}
