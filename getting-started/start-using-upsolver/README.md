## Getting started

{% hint style="info" %}
### What is Upsolver?

Upsolver is a visual, SQL-based ETL service that makes it easy to combine streaming and big historical data for analytics and Machine Learning \(ML\). 

Upsolver cuts 95% of the data lake ETL effort and improves the performance of services like AWS Athena by 100x.
{% endhint %}

### What does Upsolver do?

Upsolver ingests data from data streams and lakes, performs fully stateful transformations that were defined using SQL/UI, and delivers the data to Athena, Redshift, ElasticSearch, RDS, and so on.

Upsolver enables you to build streaming ETL pipelines with a visual UI and SQLâ€”no data engineering is required. This is a fully managed service that can be deployed on any cloud account. Upsolver scales from GBs to PBs by decoupling storage from compute.
