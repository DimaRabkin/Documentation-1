# Upsolver in 10 minutes

You have multiple options for this tutorial. The local machine option does not require you to have access to an AWS environment.

To help you get started with Upsolver, you can try it out for free. You can choose between [**Upsolver Dedicated Compute**](https://app.upsolver.com/signup) ****and [**Community**](https://app.upsolver.com/signup/free) subscriptions. Both options give you free Upsolver units \(UUs\), units of processing capability per hour based on VM instance type.

If you've signed up for Dedicated Compute, choose Amazon Web Services and integrate with your AWS account for this guide. Upsolver runs natively on both Amazon AWS and Microsoft Azure.
