# Workspaces

{% hint style="info" %}
### What are workspaces for?

Workspaces allow you to organize your Upsolver environment by users, applications, use cases, or any other way that makes the most sense to suit your specific needs.
{% endhint %}

By creating different workspaces, you can choose to work in a specific workspace and easily filter out any irrelevant objects.

Workspaces can also be used to manage access operations in conjunction with [IAM](security/identity-and-access-management/).

## Create a new workspace

1. Click on the **name** of your **current workspace** \(or **All Workspaces**\).

2. Click **Create New**.

3. **Name** your new workspace.

4. \(Optional\) Give your new workspace a **description**.

## Delete a workspace

1. Click on the **name** of your **current workspace** \(or **All Workspaces**\).

2. Click **Delete** next to the workspace to remove.

3. Click **Delete** again to confirm.
