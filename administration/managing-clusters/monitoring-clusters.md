# Monitoring clusters

The **Monitoring** tab graphs show:

* **Utilization**
  * The total usage as a percentage of the cluster over time.
* **Compute Units**
  * The number of compute units used over time. 
  * You can view the compute units consumed by the data sources and outputs in your Upsolver environment.

Mouse over the graphs to view the information for a specific period.
