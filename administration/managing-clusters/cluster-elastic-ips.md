# Cluster Elastic IPs

A list of the Elastic IP addresses in use in the cluster; you can copy one or all of the IP addresses.

Elastic IP addresses are configured so that you can provide Upsolver access \(e.g. to ElasticSearch\).

### To configure Elastic IPs

1. Define the compute cluster with Elastic IP addresses.

2. Copy the IP addresses to the ingress rules of the required resource.
