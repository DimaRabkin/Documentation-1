# Azure Blob storage connection

## Create an Azure Blob storage connection

1. Enter your **storage account name**.

2. Enter in an **access key** for your account.

{% hint style="info" %}
Both of the above can be found under **Settings &gt; Access Keys** for the storage account you wish to connect.
{% endhint %}

3. Enter the **name** of your **container**.

4. \(Optional\) Enter in the **path** to the container.

{% hint style="info" %}

{% endhint %}
