# API Playground

You can use the API Playground as a sandbox to test the API against this lookup table. This tab is only available when the lookup table is **Running**.

## Test the lookup table API

1. From the **Lookup Tables** page, click on the desired lookup table.

2. Go to the **API Playground** tab.

3. Select the API alias. By default, this option is set to **Use original API token**, but you can also select or create a new alias.   
**See:** [API Reference](../../../guide-for-developers/upsolver-rest-api/)

4. The lookup table endpoint is displayed under **Indexer Endpoint**; it includes the **apitoken** in the query string. You can **copy** the endpoint.

5. \(Optional\) Specify a **request time range**.

6. Select the key column values. You can remove and add key column item values. These values are automatically added to the query string of the **Request URL**.

4. Click **Send**. The **Response** will appear with an indication of the **Processing Time**. You can also **copy** the response.
