# Lookup table data output

{% hint style="info" %}
### What are lookup tables?

Lookup tables are a key-value store for faster lookups by key \(e.g. use a lookup table to get all users who clicked on a specific ad in a specific timeframe\).
{% endhint %}

Lookup tables are useful for:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Real-time aggregations" %}
An Upsolver lookup table replaces ETL code and a serving DB like Redis or Cassandra.

When a lookup table is defined as real time, instead of waiting until the data is written to S3 and to the disk, the eventâ€™s details \(the delta\) are updated directly in-memory and only then stored in S3.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Join between streams" %}
By querying a lookup table, it is possible to enrich one stream with data from another stream.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

You can easily create a lookup table based on any of your existing data sources using one or more keys and one or more aggregations. 

Aggregations are functions that group multiple events together to form a more significant result. An aggregation function can return a single value or a hash table. For example, `MAX` stores the maximum value for the selected stream data for each key value for the selected window period.

Unlike databases, Upsolver runs continuous queries and not ad-hoc queries. Therefore, aggregation results are incrementally updated with every incoming event.

You can also:

* Apply filters to your lookup table. 
  * These are equivalent to SQL `WHERE` statements.
* Enrich your lookup table using calculated fields. 
  * This enables you to transform your data using a variety of built-in formulas such as: 
    * running a regular expression
    * performing a mathematical operation
    * extracting structured information from your raw User-Agent data
* Add lookups to further enrich your lookup table.

## Create a lookup table data output

1. Go to the **Outputs** page and click **New**.

2. Select **Lookup Table** as your output type.

3. **Name** your output and select your **Data Sources**, then click **Next**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Click **Properties** to review this output's properties.  
**See:** [Output properties](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/modifying-the-output-properties/)
{% endhint %}

4. Click the information icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)in the fields tree to view information about a field.   
The following will be displayed:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Density in Events" %}
How many of the events in this data source include this field, expressed as a percentage \(e.g. 20.81%\).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Density in Data" %}
The density in the hierarchy \(how many of the events in this branch of the data hierarchy include this field\), expressed a percentage.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Distinct Values" %}
How many unique values appear in this field.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Total Values" %}
The total number of values ingested for this field.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="First Seen" %}
The first time this field included a value, for example, **a year ago**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Last Seen" %}
The last time this field included a value, for example, **2 minutes ago**.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Value Distribution" %}
The percentage distribution of the field values. These distribution values can be exported by clicking **Export**.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Field Content Samples Over Time" %}
A time-series graph of the total number of events that include the selected field.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Selected" %}
The most recent data values for the selected field and columns. You can change the columns that appear by clicking **Choose Columns**.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

5. Click the information icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/image%20%283%29.png)next to a hierarchy element \(such as the overall data\) to review the following metrics:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="\# of Fields" %}
The number of fields in the selected hierarchy.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="\# of Keys" %}
The number of keys in the selected hierarchy.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="\# of Arrays" %}
The number of arrays in the selected hierarchy.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fields Breakdown" %}
A stacked bar chart \(by data type\) of the number of fields versus the density/distinct values or a stacked bar chart of the number of fields by data type.
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Fields Statistics" %}
A list of the fields in the hierarchy element, including **Type, Density, Top Values, Key, Distinct Values, Array, First Seen,** and **Last Seen**.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

6. Click the plus icon![](../../../.gitbook/assets/screen-shot-2020-08-13-at-5.06.39-pm.png)in the fields tree to add a field from the data source to your output. The **Data Source Field** will be added to the **Schema** tab.   
If required, modify the **Output Column Name**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Toggle from **UI** to **SQL** at any point to view the corresponding SQL code for your selected output.

You can also edit your output directly in SQL.  
**See:** [Transform with SQL](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/modifying-the-output-in-sql/)
{% endhint %}

7. Add any required calculated fields and review them in the **Calculated Fields** tab.  
 **See:** [Adding Calculated Fields](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/adding-calculated-fields.md)

8. Add any required lookups and review them under the **Calculated Fields** tab. 

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Adding Lookups" %}
* [from data sources](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/add-lookups/adding-lookups-from-data-sources.md)
* [from lookup tables](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/add-lookups/adding-lookups-from-lookup-tables.md)
* [from reference data](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/add-lookups/adding-lookups-from-reference-data.md)
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

9. Through the **Filters** tab, add a filter like `WHERE` in SQL to the data source.  
**See:** [Adding Filters](../../data-transformation-ui/creating-an-output/adding-filters.md)

10. Click **Make Aggregated** to turn the output into an aggregated output.   
Read the warning before clicking **OK** and then add the required aggregation.   
This aggregation field will then be added to the **Schema** tab.   
**See:** [Aggregation Functions](../../../getting-started/glossary/language-guide/functions/aggregation-functions.md)

11. In the **Aggregation Calculated Fields** area under the **Calculated Fields** tab, add any required calculated fields on aggregations.   
**See:** [Functions](../../../getting-started/glossary/language-guide/functions/), [Aggregation Functions](../../../getting-started/glossary/language-guide/functions/aggregation-functions.md)

{% hint style="info" %}
Click **Preview** at any time to view a preview of your current output.
{% endhint %}

12. Click **Run** and fill out the following fields:

* **Query Cluster:** See warning below
* **Cloud Storage:** Where Upsolver stores the intermediate bulk files before loading
* **Retention:** A retention period for the data in Upsolver; after this amount of time elapsed the data will be deleted forever

**See:** [Running an Output](../../data-transformation-ui/running-an-output.md)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The default query cluster runs internal operations but does not allow external When querying from the API server, only a sample of the data is loaded.   
If the data exceeds 16 MB, some keys will not return.

To query the full data, you should create a query cluster and connect it with the lookup table.  
**See:** [How to create a query cluster](../../../administration/managing-clusters/#adding-a-query-cluster)
{% endhint %}

14. Click **Next** and complete the following:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Compute Cluster" %}
Select the compute cluster to run the calculation on.  
Alternatively, click the drop-down and [create a new compute cluster](../../../administration/managing-clusters/#adding-a-compute-cluster).
{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Processing Time Range" %}
The range of data to process.   
This can start from the data source beginning, now, or a custom date and time. This can never end, end now or end at a custom date and time.
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

15. Finally, click **Deploy** to run the output.   
 It will show as **Running** in the output panel and is now live in production and consumes compute resources.

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Note:** You can edit the contents of a new lookup table only if it has not yet run. 

Once a lookup table has run, it cannot be edited. Instead duplicate the lookup table and edit the copy.   
**See:** [Duplicating an output](../../data-transformation-ui/duplicating-an-output.md)
{% endhint %}
