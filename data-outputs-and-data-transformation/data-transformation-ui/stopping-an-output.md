# Stop an output

If necessary, you can choose to stop an output; you can also re-run the stopped output \(without changing any of the parameters\).

If you no longer need an output, you can archive it. Once an output is archived, you can either restore or delete it.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Note:** If you want to change an output, you do not need to stop it first; simply edit the output.   
**See:** [Editing an output](editing-an-output.md)
{% endhint %}

## Stop an output

1. From the **Outputs** page, select the output you wish to stop.

2. Click **Stop**. The output status should now be **Paused**.

## Re-run an output

1. From the **Outputs** page, select the **Paused** output.

2. Click **Run**.

3. Select a **compute cluster** and click **Run** again.
